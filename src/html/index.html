            <p>
                I am an immigrant from <b>Armenia</b> who has done everything to make 
                the best of his chances given to him. I began programming at the 
                age of 14, by introduction of my uncle, one of the biggest influences 
                of my life. As I grew up, I became much more interested in lower 
                level languages such as <b>Java</b> and <b>C</b>, rather than 
                javascript or python.

                <li><b>Recreational Programming</b><br>
                    Unironically, I enjoy programming very much and have created 
                    many projects simply out of interest such as a <b>Game Of Life</b> 
                    or a very simple and small <b>Neural Network</b>. 
                </li>
                <li><b>Chess</b><br>
                    Chess has been a major part of my life ever since childhood. 
                    Having played for many years professionally, I noticed that 
                    I have picked up great logical and problem solving skills which 
                    have helped me succeed in both life and school.
