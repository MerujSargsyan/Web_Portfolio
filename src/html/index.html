            <p>
                I am an immigrant from Armenia who has done everything to make 
                the best of his chances given to him. I began programming at the 
                age of 14, by introduction of my uncle, one of the biggest influences 
                of my life. As I grew up, I became much more interested in lower 
                level languages such as Java and C, rather than javascript or python.
